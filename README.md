# MIS-5400

This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists helping use employee data to predict attrition.

Data fields include various pieces of employee information. For example, Age, Attrition, Department, DistanceFromHome, 
Education, JobSatisfaction, MaritalStatus, MonthlyIncome, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany, etc.

There are 35 columns, 1471 rows for a total of 51485 pieces of data.
All data types are strings. The data looks clean and shouldn't require too much scrubbing, I think the only struggle
will be finding the factors that matter and filtering out those which do not.

Clarification on some data field classifications:
Education: 1 'Below College' 2 'College' 3 'Bachelor' 4 'Master' 5 'Doctor'
EnvironmentSatisfaction: 1 'Low' 2 'Medium' 3 'High' 4 'Very High'
